#' \describe{
#' \temps - a list of 10 temperatures in Celsius
#' \locs - a list of 10 different California locations
#' \loc_sizes - a list of the sizes in kilometers per location

#' 1 =  $1,400,000
#' 2 = $7,100,000
#' 3 = $30,000,000
#' 4 = $44,000,000
#' 5 = $600,000,000
#' \df_raw - dataframe that contains the vectors: locations, temperatures, and location sizes
#' \econ_scores - dataframe containing the locations and the associated economic scores
#' \pop_sizes - dataframe that contains the locations with the corresponding population sizes and size of the location (km)
